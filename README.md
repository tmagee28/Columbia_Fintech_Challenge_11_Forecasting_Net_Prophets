# *Columbia Fintech Challenge 11*
## *Google Colab and Time Series Analysis with FB Prophet*

With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. The task is to analyze the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, we wanted to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

Product:

Jupyter notebook that contains our data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. We use text and comments to document your findings, and we answer the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically, this file contains the following:

 - Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

 - An evaluation of how the companyâ€™s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.

 - A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

 - Answers to questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter Notebook.
